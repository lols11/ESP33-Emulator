# ESP_33 Emulator

## About
This repo contains the code for emulating ESP_33 signal in drivetrain CANBUS in VAG cars on PQ platform. 
It is generated by the ABS unit to inform PDC (PLA 3.0) module about its state.
Unfortunately older ABS units are not sending this signal, this generates an DTC in PDC unit which prevents it from work.
For PLA to work there are only two important bytes. 
*  Checksum
*  Simply 4 bit counter, incrementing with each message.

There are a few bytes that are needed to be decoded for full operation in future.
